# Chapter 4.3

### 14.

For this question, first introduce a quiet important corollary, which is

$$
\sum^{n}_{i=1}(a_i)\sum_{j=1}^{i}(b_j)=\sum_{j=1}^{n}(b_j)\sum_{i=j}^n(a_i)
$$

It is easy to prove, just by Fubini’s theorem of finite sets.

Then, we should note that in order to solve the question, we only need to deal with the Var(X), so we can always do a linear transformation to X i.e. $X^{*} = X-E(X)$,  we have E(X) = 0 but Var(X) doesn’t change.
