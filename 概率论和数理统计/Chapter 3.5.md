# Chapter 3.5

### 14. Given E(Y) and E(h(Y)) exists, prove E[h(Y)|Y] = h(Y)

When Y = y, we have h(Y) = h(y) where y and h(y) are both constant. Thus we have,

$$
E[h(y)|y]=h(y)E(1|y)=h(y)
$$

Note that we consider Y only has 1 variable here. Thus, h(Y) also has only 1 variable.

$$
E(1|y)=P(h(Y)=h(y),\ Y=y)=1
$$
