### 7. If X~F(n,n), then P(X<1)=0.5

we know that $F=\frac{X_1/m}{X_2/n}\sim F(m,n)$, then $1/F \sim F(n,m)$. Which is amazing.

Now, P(X < 1)=P(1/X >1 )=P(X>1), as P(X<1)+P(X>1) =1, we have P(X>1)=0.5

### 9.

Just recall that if (X,Y) is 2-dimensional normal distribution, and Cov(X,Y) = 0, then Corr(X,Y)=0, so X and Y are independent
